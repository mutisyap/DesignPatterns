# How it is Used

Is is used when we have a superclass with multiple subclasses and we need to return one of the subclasses on the input.

Instantiation is done fully at the factory class instead of doing it at the client program

## Advantages:
Provides approach to code for interface rather than implementation

Makes code more robust, less coupled and easy t extend. (In our example, we can easly change the PC class because the client program remains un aware.

It provides abstraction between Implementation and client classes through inheritance.
TASK; Try using interface instead of an abstract class in this example given.
